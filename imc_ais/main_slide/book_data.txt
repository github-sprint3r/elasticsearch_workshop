ElasticSearch uses the Lucene Java search library at its core for full-text indexing and search, and has REST-like HTTP and JSON APIs that make it easy to use from virtually any programming language. ElasticSearch is a fast, very scalable, and easy-to-use search engine that is enjoyable to use and work with."
